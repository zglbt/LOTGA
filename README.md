Let our TOEFL go ashore ~


## 2022.04.08
* upload TOEFL Listening tutorial of WeiChen
  * list of listening: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Fp4y1p78b?p=3
* upload TPO 01-08 Listening Lectures
  * Lecture contents: ./TPO 01-08 Listening Lecture
  * As ChenQi's words, we just need to consider these lectures as readings.
* upload TPO 01-54 Speaking Task4
  * Task4 Scripts: ./TPO 01-54 Speaking Task4 
  * Task4 Audio: ./TPO 01-54 Speaking Task4/Audio
  * There will be provided two documentary versions, which contains .doc and .pdf of scripts. According to ChenQi's notion, the Speaking Task4 has less duration of lecture than Linstening. They are more positive for us to pratice our feeling and adapt to lectures.
* upload TPO 01-54 Speaking Task6
  * Task4 Scripts: ./TPO 01-54 Speaking Task6
  * Task4 Audio: ./TPO 01-54 Speaking Task6/Audio
  * Tips are same as previous tasks. Something different is the task6 is only a lecture, but task4 contains two sections--a passage and a lecture. As a sensible idea, finishing task6 firstly is necessary.
